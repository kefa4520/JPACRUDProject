# JPA CRUD

Performing simple CRUD on a single table database.

  - utilizes a MySQL database to manipulate data
  - the MySQL table is mapped to a valid JPA Entity and tested to ensure the mappings are working correctly
  - a Spring project allows for a user to perform basic CRUD operations on the entity via a web interface.

# Learning Objectives

  - Creating a SQL database and subsequent tables.
  - Configuring a JPA project.
  - Mapping Entities to SQL tables.
  - Creating JUnit tests to ensure our JPA mappings are correct.
  - Integrating a Spring MVC project with a JPA project.
  - Performing basic CRUD operations.
  - Deploying an application to AWS

> This application provided a great opportunity to improve on overall understanding of Spring Boot MVC, as well as, how to connect it with a JPA project. The project also allowed to master CSS and JSP styling and implementation skills.
